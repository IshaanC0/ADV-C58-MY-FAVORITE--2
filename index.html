            <h4 class = "bio"> My favorite hobbie is learning steam. This is because these are in my opinion the best sieres of subjects. From coding to painting they are all connected amazingly. And all of these created our earth and everthing living on it. It uncovers everything from the darkest secrets to the brightest of times. Who wouldn't want the power of possibilities, the power of controlling everthing.
